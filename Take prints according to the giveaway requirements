I'm selling a bot that automatically participates in sweepstakes, it takes screenshots of YouTube, 
comments on the video if it's a requirement, tags friends, follows on kick.com, and of course it 
has the function of running multiple accounts. Note: it also uses chatgpt to generate random tweets 
to make the account not appear to be a bot.

If you are interested, contact me by email: nadiawiede9316542@gmail.com
I provide proof that it works.
